These hooks enable BOSH to attach created VMs to existing NSX Load Balancer Pools and NSX Distributed Firewall rulesets. BOSH uses NSX’s Security Groups [NSX Security Groups] as the underlying mechanism.\nNSX’s Security Groups are not AWS’s Security Groups. NSX’s Security Groups are rich grouping objects (in BOSH’s case, a collection of VMs) which can be associated with Load Balancer pools and firewall rulesets (Google Compute Engine’s analog would be “Tags”). AWS’s Security Groups, on the other hand, are firewall rules (e.g. “block inbound TCP port 25”).\nThis blog posts describes how to use BOSH to deploy a set of VMs as the backend of an NSX LB and to apply NSX firewall rules to those VMs. We expect this blog post to be of interest to BOSH users who deploy to vSphere environments paired with NSX with LB or security requirements (e.g. a public-facing vSphere environment).\n0.0 Plan We will deploy three VMs as a backend to an LB with a properly configured Application Profile, Virtual Server, and Pool. See the NSX Setup documentation for additional instructions.\nWe will also assign a firewall rule which disallows ssh to the three deployed VMs.\nA network diagram of our resulting deployment is shown below:\n1.0 NSX Prerequisites 1.1 Ensure the NSX Edge is enabled for Load Balancing The NSX Edge must be enabled for load balancing.\nThe name of the NSX Edge (“load-balancer”) is important — we will use this to set our BOSH Director’s Cloud Config’s vm_extensions’s nsx.lbs’s property, edge_name, in a subsequent step.\nNSX menu navigation: Edge → Manage → Load Balancer → Global Configuration → Load Balancer Status\n1.2 Configure NSX Application Profile We configure an Application Profile. We use an HTTP-type Profile with default settings.\nNSX menu navigation: Edge → Manage → Load Balancer → Application Profiles\n1.3 Configure NSX Pool (leave Members empty) We configure a backend pool for the load balancer. We use the defaults. We do not add any members to the Pool — the BOSH Director will add the members when it deploys the nginx VMs (specifically it will add the Security Group with which it has tagged the VMs it has deployed).\nThe name of the Pool (“http-pool”) is important — we will use this to set our BOSH Director’s Cloud Config’s vm_extensions’s nsx.lbs’s property, pool_name, in a subsequent step.\nNSX menu navigation: Edge → Manage → Load Balancer → Pools\n1.4 Configure NSX Virtual Server We configure the virtual server (the VM which acts as a load balancer and which has the load balancer’s IP address). The IP address of the load balancer belongs to one of the interfaces of the NSX Edge (vNIC, NSX menu navigation: Edge → Manage → Settings → Interfaces).\nThe IP address (10.85.5.84) is the load balancer, and it is the address to which we’ll point our browser during testing.\nNSX menu navigation: Edge → Manage → Load Balancer → Virtual Servers\n1.5 Create Firewall Rule and Security Group to Restrict ssh We create a firewall rule to reject ssh traffic. We specify the following:\nName (click pencil icon to modify): deny-ssh-rule Destination: Object Type: Security Group click New Security Group… Name: deny-ssh click Finish, click OK Service: ssh Action: Reject click Publish Changes The name of the Security Group (“deny-ssh”) is important — we will use this to set our BOSH Director’s Cloud Config’s vm_extensions’s nsx’s property, security_groups, in a subsequent step.\nNSX menu navigation: Networking \u0026 Security → Firewall → Configuration → General → click the first rule → click green “plus” (+) icon → make changes → click “Publish Changes”\nNSX Edges have their own, separate firewall configuration. Those are outside the scope of this blog post.\n2.0 Create BOSH Director with NSX Features 2.1 Create SSL Keys and Certificates for BOSH Director Follow these instructions to generate the certificate, CA (Certificate Authority) certificate, and key for the BOSH director. You may skip this step if you have a key and a valid, CA-issued certificate for your BOSH director. For example, if your BOSH director’s hostname is “bosh.example.com”, and you have a key and certificate for “bosh.example.com”, then you may skip this step.\n2.2 Create BOSH Director Manifest We create our BOSH director’s manifest with the properties needed to communicate with the NSX manager:\njobs: - name: bosh ... properties: ... vcenter: # \u003c--- Replace values below nsx: address: nsx.example.com user: administrator@vsphere.local password: ((nsx_password)) # CA Certificate for your NSX Manager ca_cert: | -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- ... Here is the complete BOSH Director manifest.\n2.3 Create BOSH Director using BOSH Director’s Manifest We deploy our BOSH Director. We use the BOSH Golang CLI client which allows variable interpolation (denoted by “((” and “))” in the manifest). We interpolate variables from our JSON-formatted LastPass secure note, “vsphere cpi concourse secrets”). Note that variable interpolation is not strictly necessary, and you may choose to place sensitive information such as the vCenter user’s password in plaintext in the manifest. Caveat utor.\nbosh create-env bosh-vsphere.yml -l \u003c(lpass show --note \"vsphere cpi concourse secrets\") 3.0 Create Cloud Config 3.1 Log into the BOSH Director We log into our BOSH Director. Note that we use the IP address and pass the CA Certificate of our self-generated certificate. If you have a valid cert, you should pass the hostname, not the IP address, of your BOSH director, and you do not need to specify the --ca-cert parameter.\nIn our sample manifest, the login user is admin and the password is admin.\nbosh env 10.85.57.6 --ca-cert ~/scratch/vsphere/certs/rootCA.pem bosh log-in 3.2 Create and Update Cloud Config We create a BOSH Cloud Config with NSX properties for our deployment:\nvm_extensions: - name: lb cloud_properties: nsx: security_groups: - deny-ssh # TODO: create in advance \u0026 assign firewall rules lbs: - edge_name: load-balancer pool_name: http-pool security_group: http-backend # does not need to be created in advance port: 80 The name of the VM Extension (“lb”) is important — we will use this subsequently in our deployment manifest to assign our VM to the load balancer backend and to reject ssh traffic.\nThe Edge and Pool must exist prior to the deployment; see 1.0 NSX Prerequisites for instructions. The NSX Security Group deny-ssh should be created in advance. The other Security Group, http-backend, does not need to be created in advance (BOSH will create it).\nAlthough BOSH auto-creates Security Groups (e.g. deny-ssh), it will not create corresponding firewall rules (e.g. “reject all inbound traffic to port 22”) nor attach Security Groups to the firewall rule.\nWhen to create a Security Group in advance? A good rule of thumb is this: If in doubt, create the Security Group in advance. The Security Group must be created in advance if it is used in a firewall rule, but it is not necessary when it is used as a load balancer backend. In other words, create the Security Group in advance if it is referenced under the vm_extensions.cloud_properties.nsx.security_groups property.\nWe upload our Cloud Config to the Director:\nbosh update-cloud-config cloud-config-vsphere.yml Here is the complete Cloud Config.\n4.0 Deploy VMs with NSX Configured We deploy our VMs that will function as the backend of our load balancer.\n4.1 Upload Stemcell \u0026 ngninx Release Our deployment requires a BOSH stemcell and the BOSH nginx release; we upload them to our BOSH Director:\nbosh upload-stemcell https://bosh.io/d/stemcells/bosh-vsphere-esxi-centos-7-go_agent?v=3263.8 bosh upload-release https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/nginx-release/releases/download/v4/nginx-4.tgz 4.2 Create a deployment manifest We deploy three nginx VMs. In order to associate these VMs with the Security Groups and LBs listed in the Cloud Config, we add the lb VM extension (which we defined in our Cloud Config, above) to each Instance Group\nvm_extensions requires an array value, thus lb must be enclosed in brackets.\ninstance_groups: - name: nginx instances: 1 vm_type: default vm_extensions: [lb] ... Here is the deployment manifest.\nWe deploy our VMs with our manifest:\nbosh deploy -d nginx nginx-vsphere.yml 5.0 Test 5.1 Test Load Balancer We browse to our virtual server (10.85.5.84). We hit refresh three times to ensure the load balancer cycles through each of the backend VMs.\nEach backend’s home page declares its IP address (e.g. 10.85.57.21) in a unique color (e.g. red). We can determine immediately which backend we’re hitting.\nWe see that all 3 backends are functioning properly.\n5.1 Test Firewall’s ssh Filter We ssh into one of our VMs to make sure our firewall rule is properly rejecting ssh traffic:\nfor LAST_OCTET in 21 22 23; do ssh vcap@10.85.57.${LAST_OCTET} done ssh: connect to host 10.85.57.21 port 22: Connection refused ssh: connect to host 10.85.57.22 port 22: Connection refused ssh: connect to host 10.85.57.23 port 22: Connection refused Addendum: Technical Requirements BOSH vSphere CPI v30+ (v31 tested) VMWare NSX-V 6.1+ (6.2.2 Build 3604087 tested) vSphere 6.0+ (6.0.0.20000 tested) Addendum: BOSH Documentation [BOSH vSphere CPI] (http://bosh.io/docs/vsphere-cpi.html) Addendum: NSX Documentation [NSX for vSphere Official Documentation] (https://www.vmware.com/support/pubs/nsx_pubs.html) RAML Spec Describing NSX for vSphere API (https://github.com/vmware/nsxraml) Addendum: PowerNSX Windows CLI Windows users may prefer to configure the NSX Manager via the PowerNSX CLI, a “a PowerShell module that abstracts the VMware NSX API to a set of easily used PowerShell functions”. We have not tested this ourselves (we have but few Windows machines at Pivotal).\nHistory/Corrections 2016-11-2: NSX Manager’s password is interpolated in the BOSH Director’s manifest; previously it was in plaintext.\n2016-11-2: A comment showed a command to extract the NSX Manager’s self-signed certificate. The command lent itself to a man-in-the-middle attack, so the comment has been removed.\n2016-11-3: An addendum refers to the PowerNSX CLI. Thanks Anthony Burke.\n2016-11-3: A misplaced comment in the Cloud Config indicated that the pool did not need to be created in advance; that was incorrect. The pool must be created in advance, but the Security Group does not. The comment now correctly indicates that the Security Group does not need to be created in advance.\n2016-11-4: The definition of an NSX Security Group was clarified. Also, a reference to NSX Transformers was removed. Links to the NSX documentation were added. Thanks Pooja Patel.\nFootnotes [NSX Security Groups] NSX’s Security Groups are rich grouping objects. A Security Group typically consists of a name (e.g. “deny-ssh”) and a collection of zero or more objects. In BOSH’s case, these objects are VMs (e.g. LB backend VMs). During deployment, BOSH attaches VMs to Security Groups as defined in the Cloud Config’s vm_extensions.cloud_properties.nsx section. If the Security Group is defined in a firewall rule, that firewall rule is applied to those VMs. If that Security Group is a member of a Load Balancer pool, then that VM becomes (by association) a member of the Load Balancer pool.\n","wordCount":"1818","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://nono.io/images/brian_cunnie_profile.jpg","datePublished":"2016-11-01T09:15:02-07:00","dateModified":"2016-11-01T09:15:02-07:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Brian Cunnie"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://blog.nono.io/post/nsx_with_bosh/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Brian Cunnie's Technical Blog","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://blog.nono.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://blog.nono.io/ accesskey=h title="Brian Cunnie's Technical Blog (Alt + H)">Brian Cunnie's Technical Blog</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">

in doubt, create the Security Group in advance</b>. The Security Group <em>must</em> be

Security Groups are rich grouping objects. A Security Group typically consists
of a name (e.g. &ldquo;deny-ssh&rdquo;) and a collection of zero or more objects. In BOSH&rsquo;s
case, these objects are VMs (e.g. LB backend VMs). During deployment, BOSH
attaches VMs to Security Groups as defined in the Cloud Config&rsquo;s
<code>vm_extensions.cloud_properties.nsx</code> section. If the Security Group is
defined in a firewall rule, that firewall rule is applied to those VMs.
If that Security Group is a member of a Load Balancer pool, then that VM
becomes (by association) a member of the Load Balancer pool.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://blog.nono.io/post/bosh-on-ipv6/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Using the beta BOSH CLI to Deploy an IPv6-enabled nginx Server to AWS</span>
