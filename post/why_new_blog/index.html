Why don&rsquo;t I use <a href=https://medium.com>Medium</a>?</p><p>The short version: The old blog is frozen in time, like a prince caught in amber
<sup><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine_Princes_in_Amber>1</a></sup> or a dandy
in aspic <sup><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Dandy_in_Aspic>2</a></sup>. I can no
longer post to it.</p><p>The old blog, the <em><a href=https://tanzu.vmware.com/content/pivotal-engineering-journal>Pivotal Engineering
Journal</a></em>, which
many of Pivotal&rsquo;s engineers contributed to, was archived a year after VMware
acquired Pivotal. Every acquisition brings changes, and this was, in the scheme
of things, a very minor one. At least VMware kept the blog instead of simply
discarding it.</p><p>Dozens of my blog posts, representing hundreds of hours of work, are now tucked
away in an even smaller corner of the internet. That&rsquo;s okay: technical posts
have a short shelf life. They have served their purpose.</p><p>But I cannot lay the fault at the feet of the VMware acquisition; I, too, had a
part: My interest in blogging had waned, my output, diminished. In times past I
had blogged as frequently as every two months, but then slowed to a crawl: once
every six months, and now it has been over a year since I wrote a technical blog
post.</p><p>Then the wind shifted, and I again felt the urge to write. Perhaps a VMware
corporate blog? Maybe not. I wasn&rsquo;t sure if they&rsquo;d be hands-off, allowing me to
choose my topics, express my opinions.</p><p>Perhaps Medium? I discounted that, too, for I find the experience of reading
articles on Medium unpleasant, especially the plaintive warning that accompanies
every post: &ldquo;You have 2 free member-only stories left this month. Upgrade for
unlimited access.&rdquo; I wanted my readers to have unfettered access to my writing.</p><p>Finally, I like writing in Markdown using Neovim: less mouse, more keyboard.</p><p>The winner? A combination of <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a> and <a href=https://pages.github.com/>GitHub
Pages</a>.</p><hr><footer><section><h4>Share</h4><nav class="nav sharing-icons"><a class=nav-item href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2fblog.nono.io%2fpost%2fwhy_new_blog%2f" title="Share on Facebook"><span class="fab fa-facebook-f fa-2x" aria-hidden=true></span></a><a class=nav-item href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3a%2f%2fblog.nono.io%2fpost%2fwhy_new_blog%2f" title="Share on LinkedIn"><span class="fab fa-linkedin-in fa-2x" aria-hidden=true></span></a><a class=nav-item href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3a%2f%2fblog.nono.io%2fpost%2fwhy_new_blog%2f&text=The%20Old%20Blog%20is%20Dead.%20Long%20Live%20the%20New%20Blog%21" title="Tweet this"><span class="fab fa-twitter fa-2x"></span></a></nav></section></footer></article></div><aside class="col-sm-3 ml-auto blog-sidebar"><section class=sidebar-module><h4>Links</h4><ol class=list-unstyled><li><a href=https://blog.nono.io/></a></li></ol></section></aside></div></div><footer class=blog-footer><p dir=auto>Except where otherwise noted, content on this site is licensed under a <a href=https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license</a>.</p><p><a href=#>Back to top</a></p></footer></body></html>
