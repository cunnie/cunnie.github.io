      <title>Safely Upgrading PAS 2.2 with NSX-T Load Balancers</title>
      <link>https://blog.nono.io/post/upgrade_2.2-2.3_on_nsx-t/</link>

      <description>When customers with vSphere+NSX-T-based foundations apply a stemcell update, update a tile, or upgrade PAS (Pivotal Application Service) from 2.2 to 2.3, their Cloud Foundry may become unreachable as their NSX-T static load balancer server pools have been emptied.
This blog post describes a method to ensure availability during upgrades. We use a combination of customized Operations Manager resource configs and BOSH VM Extensions.
The sample workflow in this post is for upgrading PAS 2.</description>

      <title>Deploy To vSphere NSX-T Opaque Networks Using BOSH</title>

      <description>VMware&amp;rsquo;s vSphere is an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) which runs Virtual Machines (VMs). BOSH is a VM orchestrator which automates the creation of VMs. NSX-T is a pluggable Network backend for vSphere (and other hypervisors). NSX-T allows the creation of opaque networks in vSphere, networks whose detail and configuration of the network is unknown to vSphere and which is managed outside vSphere.
With the release of BOSH vSphere CPI v40, users can attach their BOSH-deployed VMs to an NSX-T opaque network.</description>
