    We install a Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificate issued by a
    commercial Certificate Authority (CA) on a VMware VCSA 6.7 while avoiding
    several pitfalls. We also include a _Quickstart_ section for the newer
    vCenter 7.

The following section is the new Quickstart for installing a TLS certificate on vCenter 7

</div>

## vCenter 7 Quickstart

On your vCenter, navigate to **Menu → Administration → Certificates → Certificate Management**

On the *__MACHINE_CERT* tile, click **Actions**, select **Generate Certificate
Signing Request (CSR)**.

Enter the appropriate info; for inspiration, this is what we entered:

- Common name: **vcenter-70.nono.io**
- Organization: **nono.io**
- Organizational Unit: **homelab**
- Country: **United States**
- State/Province: **California**
- Locality: **San Francisco**
- Email Address: **yoyo@nono.io**
- Host: **vcenter-70.nono.io**
- Subject Alternative Name (Optional): **10.0.9.70,2601:646:100:69f0:250:56ff:fe84:2e4a**
- Key Size: **2048**

Click **Next** → **Download**. Save to a file. Click **Finish**.

Acquire a certificate for your host from a Commercial CA. In our example, we
acquired a certificate for our host `vcenter-70.nono.io`
from [SSls.com](https://ssls.com), and we purchased
their least-expensive offering, the _PositiveSSL 1 domain Comodo SSL_.

_[We do not endorse either SSLs.com or Sectigo (formerly
Comodo); We encourage you to use the reseller and the Certificate Authority
(CA) with which you are most comfortable]_.

We have 3 files:

1. Our [certificate
   file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cunnie/docs/master/tls/vcenter-70_nono_io.crt).
   This is a single (not a chain) certificate for our server,
   [vcenter-70.nono.io](https://vcenter-70.nono.io).

2. Our [chained
   certificates](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cunnie/docs/master/tls/vcenter-70_nono_io.ca-bundle).
   (CA Bundle) This chain should _not_ include the server certificate. It
   _should_ include the root certificate, which should be at the bottom of the
   chain.

   We **manually appended the root certificate to the chained certificate** file
   received from Sectigo.

3. Our [root certificate](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cunnie/docs/master/tls/SHA-2%20Root%20%20USERTrust%20RSA%20Certification%20Authority.crt). This must have a `.crt` extension.

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">

The biggest challenge is getting the correct root certificate; we strongly
suspect it can't be cross-signed: it needs to be self-signed. Check the
`openssl` and `cfssl` commands at the bottom of this post to verify that your
root certificate is self-signed. If it's not the correct root certificate,
you'll see the dreaded, "the trustAnchors parameter must be non-empty" error
message when replacing the certificates.

</div>

Navigate to **Menu → Administration → Certificates → Certificate Management**

Select **Trusted Root Certificates → Add**
- Click **Browse**
- Browse to your root certificate file and click **Add**
- If you get an error, `Error occurred while adding trusted root certificates:
  Trusted root already exists`, don't worry, vCenter already has your root
  certificate.

Select ***__MACHINE_CERT*** **→ Actions → Import and Replace Certificate**

{{< figure class="center" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1020675/78815274-e56d2200-7984-11ea-9894-2a226d7a1ab2.png" >}}

- Choose **Replace with certificate generated from vCenter server**; Click
  **Next**
- Fill in as follows:
  - **Machine SSL Certificate**: paste your certificate file here (in our case,
    the certificate for _vcenter-70.nono.io_).
  - **Chain of trusted root certificates**: paste your chained certificates
    here.
- Click **Replace**. If you see an error message, "Error occurred while fetching
  tls: Exception found (the trustAnchors parameter must be non-empty)", then you
  haven't added root certificate properly, or it's not appended at the end of
  your chained certificate, or (we suspect but aren't sure that this is a
  requirement) what you think is a self-signed root certificate is really a
  cross-signed root certificate.

<!-- vCenter server services will be automatically restarted after successful
replacement of the machine SSL certificate. -->

The following section is the original post for installing a TLS certificate on VCSA 6.7

</div>

## 0. Abstract

We want a green padlock on our VCSA's web client; when we use our browser to
navigate to our VCSA, we'd like it too look like the following:

{{< figure src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1020675/39831510-9630f47e-5379-11e8-9edf-b4ec6ca8c397.png" >}}

This blog posts describes the steps to follow in order to install a TLS
certificate on a VCSA 6.7.

*Author's note: we use our VCSA's fully qualified domain name
([FQDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_qualified_domain_name))
"vcenter-67.nono.io" throughout this document, with the understanding that you
should substitute your VCSA's FQDN accordingly.*

Note that this blog post is narrowly scoped: we are only replacing one of the
many certificates that the VCSA's services use, we are only replacing the
certificate that the human operator sees. Large enterprises may be more
interested in replacing _all_ the certificates, in which case they should refer
to this [VMware Knowledge Base
article](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/2111219).

## 1. Pre-requisites

Before we begin, we need a TLS key, a chained certificate, and a root
certificate. Also, we need to enable ssh access to our VCSA, for when
certificates go horribly wrong the web interface may be unusable, and the only
mechanism to recover (other than reinstalling) is to ssh onto the VCSA and reset
the certificates.

### 1.0 Enable OpenSSH

Enable ssh by browsing to the [Appliance Management User
Interface](https://blogs.vmware.com/vsphere/2015/09/web-based-management-for-the-vcsa-is-back.html)
(Appliance MUI, formerly known as VAMI), https://vcenter-67.nono.io:5480, and
navigating to *Access → Access Settings → Edit → Edit Access Settings → Enable
SSH Login → toggle enabled → OK*.

### 1.1 Acquire Certificate from a Commercial CA

We won't discuss how to acquire a certificate, but we will point out that Heroku has a fairly succinct (and vendor-agnostic) [description](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/acquiring-an-ssl-certificate) of the process.

Note: VCSA, like Heroku, doesn't support [elliptic
curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_cryptography) keys and only
supports RSA keys (even though, in our estimation, elliptic curves are better if
for no other reason than they are so much more [terse than
RSA](https://www.globalsign.com/en/blog/elliptic-curve-cryptography/) keys).
This means that if you use a modern tool such as
[cfssl](https://github.com/cloudflare/cfssl), you'll need to override its
defaults to force it to generate RSA keys (e.g. `cfssl print-defaults csr | jq
-r '.key = {"algo":"rsa","size":2048}'`).

After the process is complete, we should have three files:

- [`vcenter-67.nono.io.chain.pem`](https://gist.github.com/cunnie/1119b9b59c7a50391987987310c76e6d#file-vcenter-67-nono-io-chain-pem) - this is the chained certificate; your
  server's certificate should be at the top, followed by any intermediate
  certificates.
- [`vcenter-67.nono.io.key`](https://gist.github.com/cunnie/1119b9b59c7a50391987987310c76e6d#file-vcenter-67-nono-io-key) - this is the RSA private key. You can see our
  key; however, we have taken the precaution of removing several
  lines
<sup><a href="#not_what_you_think" class="alert-link">[not-what-you-think]</a></sup>
.
- [`addtrustexternalcaroot.crt`](https://support.comodo.com/index.php?/Knowledgebase/Article/View/854/75/root-addtrustexternalcaroot) — This is the root certificate
<sup><a href="#hand_wavy" class="alert-link">[hand-wavy]</a></sup>
.

## 2. Install the Certificate

### 2.0 Install the Certificate via Web Interface

- Browse to the VCSA's web client <https://vcenter-67.nono.io>
- Select "Launch vSphere Client (HTML5)" *(we use the HTML interface; Flash™ is too much for us)*
- Log in
- Menu → Administration
- Certificates → Certificate Management
- Manage Certificates of vCenter
  - Server IP/FQDN: **vcenter-67.nono.io** *(don't use "localhost")*
  - Username: **administrator@vsphere.local**
  - Password: **_WhateverYourPasswordIs_**
- Click "Log in and manage certificates"
- Trusted Root Certificates
  - Click Add
  - Certificate Chain → Browse (browse to your root certificate & upload). Click Add.
- Page should now show two Trusted Root Certificates
- Find "\_\_MACHINE\_CERT"
- Actions → Replace
  - Certificate Chain → Browse (browse to your certificate & upload)
  - Private Key → Browse (browse to your certificate & upload)
- Click Replace, success should resemble image below

{{< figure src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1020675/39830647-e237c6c0-5376-11e8-9549-600f05b9c3b2.png" >}}

Reboot the vCenter for the new certificates to take effect:
Browse to the VCSA Management Interface (VAMI),
https://vcenter-67.nono.io:5480, and navigate to *Actions → Reboot →
Reboot the system? → Yes*.

### 2.1 Install the Certificate via CLI

For those who would prefer to bypass the GUI and install the certificate via the
CLI, we offer this alternative. First, ssh into our VCSA and start a shell:

```
ssh root@vcenter-67.nono.io

    * List APIs: "help api list"
    * List Plugins: "help pi list"
    * Launch BASH: "shell"

Command> shell
```

Next we copy our certificates and keys from our workstation, `tara.nono.io`:

```bash
scp cunnie@tara.nono.io:{vcenter-67.nono.io.chain.pem,vcenter-67.nono.io.key,addtrustexternalcaroot.crt} .
```

Launch the certificate manager and install the keys and certificates:

```
/usr/lib/vmware-vmca/bin/certificate-manager
  1. Replace Machine SSL certificate with Custom Certificate
    2. Import custom certificate(s) and key(s) to replace existing Machine SSL certificate
      Please provide valid custom certificate for Machine SSL. vcenter-67.nono.io.chain.pem
      Please provide valid custom key for Machine SSL. vcenter-67.nono.io.key
      Please provide the signing certificate of the Machine SSL certificate. addtrustexternalcaroot.crt
```

Unlike the GUI, which returns immediately, the CLI spends several minutes replacing certificates. When it has finished, reboot:

```
shutdown -r now
```

### 2.2 Check: Refresh Your Browsers

Browse to the VCSA web client and confirm the certificate is installed (green
padlock). You may need to refresh the page. As a bonus, the Appliance MUI (VAMI)
has the new certificate, too!

## 3. Gotchas

If you don't upload the root certificate but update the certificate & key, after rebooting you will see the following in a red banner at the top:

> 503 Service Unavailable (Failed to connect to endpoint: [N7Vmacore4Http20NamedPipeServiceSpecE:0x00007f843400bef0] \_serverNamespace = / action = Allow \_pipeName =/var/run/vmware/vpxd-webserver-pipe)

If you browse to port 5480 and see an odd "0 -" it means you need to refresh
your browser (on macOS, ⌘-R). It may also mean that your vCenter is still
booting and that you should wait a few more minutes.

If you use an elliptic curve key, you will not be able to upload your key &
certificate; you'll see an error similar to the following:

{{< figure src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1020675/39839080-e62ccdac-538f-11e8-9b8a-c62acb55bfb1.png" >}}

If things go really bad, you won't get a login screen; instead, you'll see:

> [400] An error occurred while sending an authentication request to the vCenter
Single Sign-On server - An error occurred when processing the metadata during
vCenter Single Sign-On setup - javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException:
sun.security.validator.ValidatorException: PKIX path building failed:
sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException: unable to find valid
certification path to requested target.

You'll need to reset your certificates; see the next section.

### 3.0 Resetting the Certificates when things go wrong

If the web client is unusable, you'll need to ssh in and use
`certificate-manager` to [reset the
certificates](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/2112283). We've tested this
procedure on vCenter 6.7 & 7.0.

```
ssh root@vcenter-70.nono.io
shell
/usr/lib/vmware-vmca/bin/certificate-manager
```

Choose option 8, "Reset all Certificates". Watch the screen scroll by as it
replaces the certificates, then reboot (`shutdown -r now`).

## Footnotes

<a name="not_what_you_think"><sup>[not-what-you-think]</sup></a>

We're not publishing our private key, but not for the reasons you think. You probably think it's about security, about preventing man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. It's not. Our server is behind a firewall and can only be accessed from our internal network. If you were in a position to execute an MITM attack, it would mean that our network was grossly compromised, and the jig would be up (an MITM attack would be the least of our concerns).

No, security is not the reason. Revocation is the reason. The last time that we published a private key, our certificate was revoked in a rather [spectacular manner](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10184866), and the CA refused to issue us another one unless we promised not to publish it. We agreed, and we hew to our agreement, for we are men of our word.

<a name="hand_wavy"><sup>[hand-wavy]</sup></a>

This is the most hand-wavy part of the blog post, obtaining the root
certificate. On one hand, root certificates are everywhere — every one of the
billions of browsers has a copy of the [approximately
160](https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA/Included_Certificates) root certificates.

On the other hand, you may have to do some digging. Whichever CA you choose
should publish their root certificate. Sectigo, for example, publishes their root
certificate
[here](https://support.comodo.com/index.php?/Knowledgebase/Article/View/854/75/root-addtrustexternalcaroot).

If that's a dead-end, you may want to check [Mozilla's list](https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA/Included_Certificates) of root certificates.

We had an interesting experience where one version of the [Sectigo root
certificate](https://crt.sh/?id=1199354) whose canonical name (CN) was "USERTrust RSA
Certification Authority", worked, but the intermediate certificate included in the chain,
whose canonical name was also "USERTrust RSA Certification Authority", and which
we mistakenly took for a root certificate, did not work.

To determine if the certificate you have is a root certificate, confirm the
subject is the same as the issuer. In the following example, we use two common
TLS command line tools (`cfssl` and `openssl`) to examine the Sectigo root
certificate `addtrustexternalcaroot.crt` and ensure the issuer is the same as
the subject:

First we use `cfssl`, whose output is JSON, which we pipe to `jq` to extract the
Common Name of the issuer and subject:

```bash
cfssl certinfo -cert addtrustexternalcaroot.crt |
  jq -r '[ .issuer.common_name, .subject.common_name ]'
```
produces:
```
[
  "AddTrust External CA Root",
  "AddTrust External CA Root"
]
```
With `openssl` we can use a simple `egrep` to extract the information we need.
```bash
openssl x509 -in addtrustexternalcaroot.crt -noout -text |
  egrep "Issuer:|Subject:"
```
produces:
```
Issuer: C=SE, O=AddTrust AB, OU=AddTrust External TTP Network, CN=AddTrust External CA Root
Subject: C=SE, O=AddTrust AB, OU=AddTrust External TTP Network, CN=AddTrust External CA Root
```

Now, when faced with the above output, a reasonable might ask, "why on earth is
Comodo using Addtrust's root certificate? Why don't they use their own
certificate?" One can only speculate.

# Corrections & Updates

*2020-12-26*

Re-wrote instructions to have vCenter generate the CSR. It appears to work
better, specifically with regard to the update manager (though I can't find the
links to bolster that assertion).

*2020-05-22*

Updated to include newly-issued TLS certificates to replace the ones that had
been revoked, but this time we did not publish the private key (the cause of the
revocation).

We deprecate _Comodo_ in favor of _Sectigo_, the new name.

*2020-04-08*

We include a Quickstart section for vCenter 7.
