  A BOSH director is typically deployed with self-signed SSL (Secure Sockets
  Layer) certificates; however, the director can be deployed with certificates
  issued by a trusted CA (Certificate Authority). Here's how.
title: Deploying a BOSH Director With SSL Certificates Issued by Commercial CA
---

## 0. Abstract

A BOSH director is a virtual machine (VM) orchestrator which deploys VMs to
various Infrastructures as a Service (IaaS) such as Amazon Web Services (AWS)
and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The BOSH Command Line (CLI) communicates with
the director over Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). While most BOSH directors are
deployed with self-signed certificates, it is possible to configure a BOSH
director with certificates issued by a recognized certificate authority (CA)
(e.g. Comodo, Symantec, Let's Encrypt). This blog post describes a technique to
deploy a BOSH director with a CA-issued SSL certificate.

Additionally, this blog posts describes a mechanism to override the
automatically-generated passwords (e.g. for logging into the director from the
CLI).

This blog post may be of use to organizations who desire the following:

- use CA-issued SSL certificates on their BOSH director
- set specific passwords on the BOSH director's services (e.g. login, PostgreSQL)
- dispense with the `--var-store` file (which stores the auto-generated passwords
and the self-signed SSL certificate authority's certificate), a file created by
the BOSH CLI during deployment and which normally must be stored in a safe
&amp; secure manner

This blog posts assumes familiarity with [BOSH CLI
v2](https://bosh.io/docs/cli-v2.html) and with the procedure to deploy a BOSH
director.

The blog post describes deploying (i.e. creating) a BOSH director
([bosh-gce.nono.io](https://bosh-gce.nono.io:25555/info)) to the Google Cloud
Platform.

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">

The BOSH Development Team has put much engineering into the CA/certificate
generation & workflow and also in generating secure (i.e. high entropy)
passwords. By following the instructions in this blog post, you're deliberately
tossing that work aside, and may open your BOSH director to subtle (or perhaps
not-so-subtle) attacks. At the very least you void your warranty.

You have been warned.

</div>

## 1. Overview of the Procedure To Deploy a BOSH Director

The procedure to deploy a BOSH director with valid SSL certificate is a superset
of the [normal procedure](https://bosh.io/docs/init-google.html) to deploy a
BOSH director, with an additional step: using `bosh interpolate` to create an
intermediate manifest.

Below is a visual diagram of the process:

{{<figure src="https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1cpwqxuoAcGJbVfQxFXrYA9ZXf6XqEA4jZEVMozczfLk/pub?w=1224&amp;h=1584">}}

## 2. Deploying the BOSH Director to GCP

### 2.1 Pre-requisites: IP addresses, DNS Records, and SSL Certificates

We are deploying our BOSH director to Google Cloud Platform (GCP), so we
acquire an external IP address via the GCP console.

* **104.154.39.128** — the external IP address acquired from GCP. Note that
the IP address need not be a public address — in fact, most BOSH directors have
private ([RFC 1918](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918)) addresses. Having
one's BOSH directors reachable solely via a jumpbox adds a layer of security.
* **bosh-gce.nono.io** — the DNS record must point to the director's IP address
(i.e. 104.154.39.128)
(`dig +short bosh-gce.nono.io` returns the expected IP address).
* **SSL Certificate** — we use a wildcard certificate (i.e. **\*.nono.io**), but
a wildcard certificate is not necessary, and a regular SSL certificate
(e.g. bosh-gce.nono.io) is much less expensive.

### 2.2 Create a Manifest Operations (`gce.yml`) File to Insert the SSL Certificate

We create a manifest operations YAML file (`gce.yml`) that contains the
directives to adjust the generic BOSH director's manifest template (`bosh.yml`)
to use our CA-issued certificate.  Our certificate is a chained certificate,
which means that it includes the CA bundle (i.e. the certificates of the CAs
that issued our certificate). <sup><a href="#root_cert"
class="alert-link">[Chained Certificate]</a></sup>

We use a variables to substitute the SSL certificate and key in our manifest
(`((nono_io_crt))` and  `((nono_io_key))`, respectively), which will be
interpolated in the second stage (double parentheses, "`(())`", are an indicator
to the BOSH CLI parser to perform variable substitution).

Below is a shortened version of our manifest operations file; the full one can be
viewed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/cunnie/deployments/blob/7511ba27ba5d23b40e7cd2b15d7f9bbd6df0465a/etc/gce.yml):

```YAML
- type: replace
  path: /instance_groups/name=bosh/properties/director/ssl/key?
  value: ((nono_io_key))
- type: replace
  path: /instance_groups/name=bosh/properties/director/ssl/cert?
  value: ((nono_io_crt))
```

### 2.3 Create the SSL Certificate (`nono.io.crt`) File

We create a PEM-formatted ([Privacy Enhanced
Mail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy-enhanced_Electronic_Mail)) file that
contains the SSL chained certificate.

We will set the `nono_io_crt` variable via the CLI to the contents of the
`nono.io.crt` file when we perform our first stage, interpolation, which will
substitute the SSL certificate in the appropriate locations.

Our certificate file  can be viewed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/cunnie/deployments/blob/7511ba27ba5d23b40e7cd2b15d7f9bbd6df0465a/etc/nono.io.crt).

### 2.4  Run `bosh interpolate` to Create Intermediate Manifest

We run the `bosh interpolate` to create our intermediate manifest,
`bosh-gce.yml`.

<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">

If you're not interested in creating an intermediate manifest, you're better off
using <b>bosh create-env</b> instead of <b>bosh interpolate</b>; your workflow
will be simpler. You can use the same arguments as <b>bosh interpolate</b>, but
be sure to include the additional secrets file as a parameter, e.g. <b>-l
secrets.yml</b>.

</div>

<p />

```bash
bosh interpolate ~/workspace/bosh-deployment/bosh.yml \
  -o ~/workspace/bosh-deployment/misc/powerdns.yml \
  -o ~/workspace/bosh-deployment/gcp/cpi.yml \
  -o ~/workspace/bosh-deployment/external-ip-not-recommended.yml \
  -o ~/workspace/bosh-deployment/jumpbox-user.yml \
  -o etc/gce.yml \
  --var-file nono_io_crt=etc/nono.io.crt \
  -v dns_recursor_ip="169.254.169.254" \
  -v internal_gw="10.128.0.1" \
  -v internal_cidr="10.128.0.0/20" \
  -v internal_ip="10.128.0.2" \
  -v external_ip="104.154.39.128" \
  -v network="cf" \
  -v subnetwork="cf-e6ecf3fd8a498fbe" \
  -v tags="[ cf-internal, cf-bosh ]" \
  -v zone="us-central1-b" \
  -v project_id="blabbertabber" \
  -v director_name="gce" \
  > bosh-gce.yml
```

The first argument to `bosh interpolate` is the BOSH director manifest template
file, `~/workspace/bosh-deployment/bosh.yml`. This has the generic defaults for
a BOSH director (e.g. persistent disk size of 32,768MB, the five jobs of the
director, etc...). The source of this file is the
[bosh-deployment](#bosh_deployment) git repo, which has been cloned to
`~/workspace/bosh-deployment/` on our workstation.

The `-o` (`--ops-file`) ("manifest operations from a YAML file") are a set of
files which configure the BOSH director with specific attributes. With the
exception of our custom (`gce.yml`), the manifest operations files reside in the
`bosh-deployment` repository.

Here is the list of manifest operations files and their purpose:

* `misc/powerdns.yml`: this is only needed for
[dynamic networks](https://bosh.io/docs/networks.html#dynamic), where the IaaS,
rather than the director, assigns IP addresses to the VMs deployed by the
director. The BOSH development team is doing [interesting
work](https://bosh.io/docs/dns.html) with hostname resolution (DNS), and this particular manifest
operations file will likely be deprecated soon.
* `gcp/cpi.yml`: this is needed for deploying a BOSH director to GCP, it sets
properties such as `machine_type` (`n1-standard-1`).
* `external-ip-not-recommended.yml`: this is not recommended for general use;
it's for deploying a BOSH director with a publicly-accessible IP address.
<sup><a href="#security" class="alert-link">[Security]</a></sup>
* `jumpbox-user.yml`: this creates an account, _jumpbox_, on the director. This
account has `sudo` privileges and can be ssh'ed into using an ssh key. In our
example, the interpolated variable `gce_jumpbox_user_public_key`, contains the
public key which will be inserted into the file `~jumpbox/.ssh/authorized_keys`
on the BOSH director. The private key is kept in `~/.ssh/google` on our
workstation. The command to ssh into our director is the following:
`ssh -i ~/.ssh/google jumpbox@bosh-gce.nono.io`

The `--var-file nono_io_crt=etc/nono.io.crt` directive tells the BOSH CLI to
substitute every occurrence of `((nono_io_crt))` with the contents of the file
`etc/nono.io.crt`) (our SSL certificate).

The `-v` arguments set variables which are interpolated, e.g. `-v
dns_recursor_ip="169.254.169.254"` replaces occurrences of `((dns_recursor_ip))`
with `169.254.169.254` in our manifest.

We use a script to create our intermediate manifest; our script can be viewed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/cunnie/deployments/blob/980ae18de7d82b8e1c66b0d6b55eda05e2c7950c/bin/gce.sh).

Our intermediate manifest (without secrets) can also be seen on
[GitHub](https://github.com/cunnie/deployments/blob/980ae18de7d82b8e1c66b0d6b55eda05e2c7950c/bosh-gce.yml).

### <a name="secrets_file">2.5 Create a Secrets File</a>

We create a YAML file with our secrets (passwords and keys). These will be
substituted during the second stage (`bosh create-env`). Below is a redacted
version of a portion of our file (the passwords aren't the real passwords; don't
even bother trying to use them) (the public ssh key, however, is the real deal)
(the GCP credentials JSON values are mostly real, too):

### 2.6 Deploying the director

Deploying the director is a bit anticlimactic. In this example, we assume
the name of the file which contains our secrets which we created in the
previous step is named `secrets.yml`:

```bash
bosh create-env bosh-gce.yml -l secrets.yml
```

In a more complex example (we use LastPass&trade; to store our secrets in a note
named `deployments.yml`), we take advantage of bash's [process
substitution](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Process-Substitution.html)
to take the output of the LastPass CLI's command and make it appear as a file
argument to the BOSH CLI:

```bash
bosh create-env bosh-gce.yml -l <(lpass show --note deployments.yml)
```

Remember to save the `bosh-gce-state.json` file — it contains the location of
the persistent disk, which is important if you ever decide to re-deploy your
BOSH director, for the director's state (including deployments, releases,
stemcells) is stored on the persistent disk.

## 3. Optimizations: Collapse Two Stages into One

The two stages can be collapsed into one by dispensing with the `bosh interpolate`
section and merging its options with the `bosh create-env` step. Indeed, the
only advantage of using a two-stage process is the creation of the intermediate
BOSH director manifest file, `bosh-gce.yml`.

## 4. SSL Certificates on Other Infrastructures

This technique applies equally well to other IaaSes (such as AWS, Azure, and vSphere). As a proof of concept, we have deployed BOSH directors with
CA-issued SSL certificates to each of the IaaSes listed below (ignore the "forbidden"
page when clicking _BOSH Director_ links; instead, pay attention
to the valid SSL certificate presented to the browser):

| Infrastructure | BOSH Director (URL) | BOSH Director Manifest |
| -----|---------------|----|
| Amazon AWS | <https://bosh-aws.nono.io:25555/info> | [bosh-aws.yml](https://github.com/cunnie/deployments/blob/17f8300550e5f3830ea56db91e1c7442cf026505/bosh-aws.yml) |
| Google GCP | <https://bosh-gce.nono.io:25555/info> | [bosh-gce.yml](https://github.com/cunnie/deployments/blob/17f8300550e5f3830ea56db91e1c7442cf026505/bosh-gce.yml) |
| Microsoft Azure | <https://bosh-azure.nono.io:25555/info> | [bosh-azure.yml](https://github.com/cunnie/deployments/blob/17f8300550e5f3830ea56db91e1c7442cf026505/bosh-azure.yml) |
| VMware vSphere | <https://bosh-vsphere.nono.io:25555/info> | [bosh-vsphere.yml](https://github.com/cunnie/deployments/blob/17f8300550e5f3830ea56db91e1c7442cf026505/bosh-vsphere.yml) |

## 5. Addendum: UAA and CredHub

[UAA](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/uaa) (CloudFoundry User Account and
Authentication) and [CredHub](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/credhub)
are optional BOSH director jobs that replace the built-in BOSH login mechanism
<sup><a href="#uaa" class="alert-link">[login]</a></sup>.

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">

Integrating UAA and CredHub into a BOSH director deployed with a commercial SSL
certificate is very preliminary and may be <b>incomplete and even broken</b>. Although
we have successfully deployed a BOSH director, logged in, and re-created a deployment,
we have by no means fully exercised our BOSH director's capabilities. Use caution
when following this process.

</div>

<p/>

When deploying UAA and CredHub with our BOSH director, we must do additional
modifications to the director manifest to ensure it deploys properly and that we
can log in. Specifically, we need to add our certificate to UAA's endpoint (port
8443) and modify the director's manifest to connect to the fully qualified
domain name of that endpoint (e.g. `https://bosh-gce.nono.io:8443`)

Deploying a BOSH director with an external IP and which is running the CredHub
job  requires special modifications that have not yet, as of this writing, been
incorporated into `bosh-deployment`. The following modifications were copied
from a Slack channel (_caveat utor_), **but they are not enough for our
purposes**:

```
- type: replace
  path: /variables/name=credhub_tls/options/alternative_names/-
  value: ((external_ip))

- type: replace
  path: /variables/name=credhub_tls/options/common_name
  value: ((external_ip))

- type: replace
  path: /instance_groups/name=bosh/jobs/name=credhub/properties/credhub/authentication/uaa/url
  value: "https://((external_ip)):8443"

- type: replace
  path: /instance_groups/name=bosh/properties/director/config_server/uaa/url
  value: "https://((external_ip)):8443"
```

But the changes above aren't enough for our purposes: although they work well
for BOSH directors with auto-generated (self-signed) certificates, they won't
work with our commercial certificate (we'll see an error similar to the
following: `x509: cannot validate certificate for 104.154.39.128 because it
doesn't contain any IP SANs`).

To address this, we set a variable that has FQDN ([fully qualified domain
name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_qualified_domain_name)) of the BOSH
director (e.g. `bosh-gce.nono.io`). This must be the same domain name for which
our SSL certificate is issued. The name of the variable is unimportant (we named
our variable `external_fqdn`). We name our updated manifest operations file
[TLS.yml](https://github.com/cunnie/deployments/blob/94247c79cbdf8a2aaff8a353005971788890249c/etc/TLS.yml#L31-L51)
and inject not only the FQDN but also the commercial TLS certificate and key:

```
- type: replace
  path: /instance_groups/name=bosh/jobs/name=uaa/properties/uaa/sslCertificate?
  value: ((nono_io_crt))
- type: replace
  path: /instance_groups/name=bosh/jobs/name=uaa/properties/uaa/sslPrivateKey?
  value: ((nono_io_key))
- type: replace
  path: /instance_groups/name=bosh/jobs/name=uaa/properties/uaa/url?
  value: https://((external_fqdn)):8443
- type: replace
  path: /instance_groups/name=bosh/jobs/name=credhub/properties/credhub/authentication/uaa/ca_certs/-
  value: ((commercial_ca_crt))
- type: replace
  path: /instance_groups/name=bosh/jobs/name=credhub/properties/credhub/authentication/uaa/url?
  value: https://((external_fqdn)):8443
- type: replace
  path: /instance_groups/name=bosh/properties/director/config_server/uaa/url?
  value: https://((external_fqdn)):8443
- type: replace
  path: /instance_groups/name=bosh/properties/director/user_management/uaa/url?
value: https://((external_fqdn)):8443
```

We also set our FQDN variable when invoking BOSH: [`bosh create-env -v
external_fqdn="bosh-gce.nono.io ..."`](https://github.com/cunnie/deployments/blob/94247c79cbdf8a2aaff8a353005971788890249c/bin/gce.sh#L48).

If we get an `i/o timeout` while logging in or performing a BOSH operation,
then there's a good chance that we forgot to open up TCP port 8443.

```
Performing request GET 'https://bosh-gce.nono.io:25555/tasks?state=processing%!C(MISSING)cancelling%!C(MISSING)queued&verbose=2':
  Performing GET request:
    Requesting token via client credentials grant: Performing request POST 'https://bosh-gce.nono.io:8443/oauth/token': Performing POST request: Retry: Post https://bosh-gce.nono.io:8443/oauth/token: dial tcp bosh-gce.nono.io:8443: i/o timeout
```

To test if UAA and CredHub are working properly, log into your BOSH director
(i.e. `bosh login`).

## Acknowledgements

[Dmitriy Kalinin](https://github.com/cppforlife/) suggested collapsing the two
stages into one, and making the title more accurate. [Danny
Berger](https://github.com/dpb587) suggested adopting a more objective tone with
respect to the current set of security tools (i.e. iptables, SELinux, AppArmor,
auditd).

## Footnotes

<a name="security"><sup>[Security]</sup></a> The author has mixed feelings
for many of the best-practices in the security space; for example, the author
feels that firewalls are no substitute for knowing which services should
(and should not) be running on one's server and that tools such as
[AppArmor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AppArmor),
[SELinux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security-Enhanced_Linux), and
[auditd](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/Security_Guide/chap-system_auditing.html) often introduce subtle and hard-to-debug failures at the
expense of arguably modest security improvements.

<a name="root_cert"><sup>[Chained Certificates]</sup></a> The order in which the
certificates appear and whether the root certificate is included is important.

We recommend placing the server's certificate topmost and the root
certificate last in order to conform with the [Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol
Version 1.2 Request For Comment
(RFC)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5246#section-7.4.2):

> This is a sequence (chain) of certificates.  The sender's
certificate MUST come first in the list.  Each following
certificate MUST directly certify the one preceding it.  Because
certificate validation requires that root keys be distributed
independently, the self-signed certificate that specifies the root
certificate authority MAY be omitted from the chain, under the
assumption that the remote end must already possess it in order to
validate it in any case.

We recommend omitting the root certificate (and so do
[others](https://community.qualys.com/thread/11026)), for it is the one
certificate that is included on every client machine, so there's no need to
transmit it (and if it's not already on the client machine, then you have bigger
worries).

The recommendation for certificate ordering has been borne out in practice.
Apache, for example, [recommends placing the server certificate
first](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_ssl.html#sslcertificatefile),
and the root certificate last:

> The files may also include intermediate CA certificates, sorted from leaf to root

Nginx makes a similar [recommendation](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/configuring_https_servers.html#chains):

> The server certificate must appear before the chained certificates in the combined file

[Golang, too](https://golang.org/pkg/crypto/tls/#Certificate):

> A Certificate is a chain of one or more certificates, leaf first.

For those curious about how a root certificate differs from a regular certificate,
the answer is simple: the root certificate is a self-signed certificate. That
is to say, the certificate's _Subject_ is the same as the _Issuer_.

We can use the `openssl` command to examine our server certificate and determine
that the Issuer and Subject are different, and thus be sure that our server
certificate is not a root certificate:

```
$ openssl x509 -in etc/nono.io.crt -noout -text | egrep "Subject:|Issuer:"
        Issuer: C=GB, ST=Greater Manchester, L=Salford, O=COMODO CA Limited, CN=COMODO RSA Domain Validation Secure Server CA
        Subject: OU=Domain Control Validated, OU=PositiveSSL Multi-Domain, CN=*.nono.io
```

The presence of the root certificate in the chain may cause validation problems;
The author, for example, recollects fixing a problem where his web server's
certificate was flagged as invalid on Android (but not on other platforms). It
was fixed by removing the root certificate from the certificate chain file.

<a name="uaa"><sup>[login]</sup></a>
UAA's primary role is as an OAuth2 provider, issuing tokens for client
applications to use when they act on behalf of BOSH users, and
authenticate users with their BOSH credentials (e.g. `bosh login`).
CredHub manages credentials like passwords, certificates, certificate
authorities, SSH keys, RSA keys and arbitrary values (strings and JSON blobs),
CredHub provides a CLI and API to get, set, generate and securely store such
credentials.

Tweaked the wording in the title (added "Recognized CA"), emphasized collapsing
the two stages into one, centered the labels in the boxes, updated the URL for
go-patch.

We dispensed with `mbus_bootstrap_ssl` file; it was both complex and
unnecessary.

We fixed a bug where the mbus bootstrap SSL was interpolated incorrectly,
resulting in an error (`cannot unmarshal !!str 'certifi...' into
manifest.Certificate`) when using newer versions (>= 2.0.32) of the BOSH CLI.

We refactored the SSL certificate into its own file, `nono.io.crt`.

Changed the title from "... Recognized CA" to "... Commercial CA". "Commercial"
is the term [Wikipedia uses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority).

Added the section, _Addendum: UAA and CredHub_.
