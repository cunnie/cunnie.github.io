In our previous blog post, we set up our Kubernetes cluster and deployed a pod
running nginx, but the experience was disappointing—we couldn't browse to our
pod. Let's fix that by deploying the nginx Ingress controller. It's simple; it's
a one-liner:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/controller-v0.48.1/deploy/static/provider/cloud/deploy.yaml
```
