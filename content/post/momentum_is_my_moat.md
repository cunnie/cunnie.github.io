I run a DNS service, sslip.io, a service so simple that at least 8 different
people have created an identical service. One even said, "I built [similar
service] when I couldn't quite remember" [0] sslip.io's name. That's right, it was
easier to build from scratch than spend a few minutes on Google searches. And
this was before Claude.ai made coding easy!

This begs the question: "If it's so easy to code your service, if it's so easy
to spin up a VPS (virtual private server), then why should anyone use your
service over someone else's? What's your moat?"

Simple. My moat is momentum. I've been keeping my service running, day in, day
out, for over ten years. No outages. It just works.
