`8.8.8.8` is Google's "[free, global DNS resolution
service](https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns)", so popular that it's
been lampooned by [XKCD](https://xkcd.com/1361/). It has a wonderfully
straightforward front-end: the IP address `8.8.8.8`. But that begs the
question: what's on the back-end? Do the authoritative nameservers receive
queries from `8.8.8.8` or some other IP address? The answer may surprise you.

Spoiler: the queries don't originate from `8.8.8.8`; instead, the queries
originate from a range of IP addresses. Also, the queries tend to favor IPv6
nameservers over IPv4 nameservers. By a large margin.

### Testing 8.8.8.8

To see how `8.8.8.8` queries authoritative nameservers, I need an authoritative
nameserver, preferably one that receives a significant amount of DNS traffic.
Luckily, I happen to be in possession of such a nameserver (well, four such
nameservers).

You see, I run nip.io & [sslip.io](https://sslip.io), DNS services which
receive about 20,000 DNS queries every second, a rich vein to mine.

Let's send a slew of carefully-marked DNS queries to `8.8.8.8`, ones that will
be forwarded to our nameservers.

```bash
for i in $(seq 0 255); do
  dig +short 8-8-8-8.test-$i.sslip.io @8.8.8.8
done
```

Now let's get onto the nameserver and see what the logs look like:

```bash
ssh ns-ovh.sslip.io
```

### An Aside: the Balancing Act

Note that I have three nameservers and between them they answer 20,890 queries
per second, but the traffic isn't balanced evenly — one server carries more
than four-fifths of the traffic! Don't take my word for it; here are the stats:

| nameserver          | queries <br />/sec  | location |
| ------------------- | -------: | -------- |
| ns-do-sg.sslip.io   | 1060     | Singapore     |
| ns-gce.sslip.io     | 420      | Iowa, USA     |
| ns-hetzner.sslip.io | 2,250    | Oregon, USA   |
| ns-ovh.sslip.io     | 17,160   | Warsaw, Poland   |

`ns-ovh` carries 82% of the traffic! Why the imbalance? I don't know, but
`ns-ovh` is unique among the webservers in that it's not a VM — it's baremetal.
It's OVH's [KS-4](https://eco.us.ovhcloud.com/?display=list&range=kimsufi)
(Intel Xeon-E3 1230v6 - 4 c / 8 t - 3.5 GHz / 3.9 GHz).

_Personal note: I'm not sponsored by OVH, in fact, quite the opposite: I pay
them $20/month in hosting costs. But I will say this: of all the VMs I've had
on all the cloud providers, this one is worth its weight in gold. Baremetal,
low latency, SSDs, generous bandwidth — it's head and shoulders above the
rest._

### Back to the Logs

Let's dump our DNS server's logs. My DNS server is run as a systemd service, so
I can use `journalctl` to retrieve the logs since yesterday and write them to a
temporary file. It's a lot of logs: the command takes seven minutes to run and
produces a 1.5 GiB log file:

```bash
sudo journalctl -u sslip.io-dns -S yesterday > /tmp/sslip.io.log
```

Now let's find out who's querying us the most, using a "Greatest Hits" of UNIX
command line utilities:

```bash
awk '{print $8}' < /tmp/sslip.io.log | \
  grep -v "nil, SOA" | \
  sed 's/\.[0-9]*$//' | \
  sort | \
  uniq -c | \
  sort -n | \
  tail -50
```

We find our results below (timestamps removed for legility):

```
2607:f8b0:4004:1002::12c.63077 TypeA 8-8-8-8.test-2.sSlip.iO. ? 8.8.8.8
2607:f8b0:4004:1000::122.44642 TypeA 8-8-8-8.test-163.SSLIp.IO. ? 8.8.8.8
2607:f8b0:4004:1002::129.36477 TypeA 8-8-8-8.test-194.SsliP.iO. ? 8.8.8.8
172.253.0.29.42710 TypeA 8-8-8-8.test-208.sslip.io. ? 8.8.8.8
2607:f8b0:4004:1001::122.54414 TypeA 8-8-8-8.test-215.ssliP.iO. ? 8.8.8.8
```

Let's break down the log file, using the first line as an illustrative example:

- `2607:f8b0:4004:1002::12c` the address from which the DNS query came; in this
case, an IPv6 address.
- `63077` the port number from which the DNS query came
- `TypeA` the type of record; an `A` record is an address record
- `8-8-8-8.test-2.sSlip.iO.` the query. Notice the random capitalization (this
  didn't come from us; Google's nameservers introduced it).
- `?` this was a DNS query
- `8.8.8.8` this was the address (DNS A record) that we returned
