`8.8.8.8` is Google's "[free, global DNS resolution
service](https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns)", so popular that it's
been lampooned by [XKCD](https://xkcd.com/1361/). It has a wonderfully
straightforward front-end: the IP address `8.8.8.8`. But that begs the
question: what's on the back-end? Do the authoritative nameservers receive
queries from `8.8.8.8` or some other IP address? The answer may surprise you.

Spoiler: the queries don't originate from `8.8.8.8`; instead, the queries
originate from a range of IP addresses. Also, the queries tend to favor IPv6
nameservers over IPv4 nameservers. By a large margin.

### Testing 8.8.8.8

To see how `8.8.8.8` queries authoritative nameservers, I need an authoritative
nameserver, preferably one that receives a significant amount of DNS traffic.
Luckily, I happen to be in possession of such a nameserver (well, three such
nameservers).

You see, I run [sslip.io](https://sslip.io), a DNS service which receives about
3,700 DNS queries every second, a rich vein to mine.

Let's send a slew of carefully-marked DNS queries to `8.8.8.8`, ones that will
be forwarded to our nameservers.

```bash
for i in $(seq 0 255); do
  dig +short 8-8-8-8.test-$i.sslip.io @8.8.8.8
done
```

Now let's get onto the nameserver and see what the logs look like:

```bash
ssh ns-ovh.sslip.io
```

### An Aside: the Balancing Act

Note that I have three nameservers, but the traffic isn't balanced evenly
between them â€” one server carries more than half the traffic!
Don't take my word for it; here are the stats:

| nameserver          | queries <br />/sec  | location |
| ------------------- | -------: | -------- |
| ns-gce.sslip.io     | 434.0    | Iowa     |
| ns-hetzner.sslip.io | 890.4    | Oregon   |
| ns-ovh.sslip.io     | 2366.5   | Warsaw   |

`ns-ovh` carries 64% of the traffic! Why the imbalance? I suspect that CPU
plays a role: the CPU on `ns-gce` is maxed-out even though it carries but 11%
of the traffic, and every time I visit the Google Cloud Platform console they
recommend I upgrade the machine from an
[e2-micro](https://cloud.google.com/compute/vm-instance-pricing#sharedcore_machine_types)
to an `e2-small`.
