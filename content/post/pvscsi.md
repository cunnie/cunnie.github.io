Our benchmarks show that VMware's Paravirtual SCSI (small computer system
interface) controller offered a 2-3% performance increase in IOPS (I/O
(input/output) operations per second) over the LSI Logic Parallel SCSI
controller at the cost of a similar decrease in sequential performance (both
read & write). Additionally the Paravirtual SCSI controller (pvscsi) had a
slight reduction in CPU (central processing unit) usage on the host best-case
scenario is a 3% lower CPU usage).

### Why These Benchmarks Are Flawed

- **We only tested one type of datastore**. We tested an NVMe (non-volatile
  memory express) datastore, but it would have been interesting to test VMware's
  vSAN (virtual storage area network).

- **We only ran the benchmark for an hour**. Had we run the benchmark longer, we
  would have seen different performance curves. For example, when we ran the
  benchmarks back-to-back we saw degradation of the throughput from almost 2
  GB/s to slightly more than 1 GB/s on the sequential read & write tests. We
  attribute this degradation to saturation of the Samsung controller.

- **We never modified the kernel settings to enhance pvscsi performance**. For
  example, went with the default settings for queue depth for device (64) and
  adapter (254), but this VMware [knowledgebase (KB)
  article](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/2053145) suggests increasing those to
  254 and 1024, respectively.

- **We only tested Linux**. Windows performance may be different.

- **We benchmarked slightly different versions of Linux**. We tested against two
  very-close versions of Ubuntu Bionic, but they weren't the _exact_ same
  version. Had we used completely identical versions, we may have seen different
  performance numbers.
