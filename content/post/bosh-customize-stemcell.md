  BOSH Stemcells are Linux-based bootable disk images upon which BOSH applications
  may be deployed. This blog post describes a process to customize a
  stemcell (most often used to troubleshoot stemcell boot problems).
title: How to Customize a BOSH Stemcell
---

In this blog post, we describe the procedure we followed in order to create a
custom Google Compute Engine (GCE) stemcell with a user `cunnie` whose
`~/.ssh/authorized_keys` is pre-populated with a specific public key.

<div class="alert alert-error" role="alert">

Customizing stemcells is highly discouraged — it voids your warranty, and opens
a host of problems which will only cause pain. This post is intended as an
educational demonstration of the stemcell building process. You have been warned.

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">

This blog post describes <i>customizing</i> a stemcell, not <i>building</i> a
stemcell from scratch. The BOSH GitHub repository has an <a class="alert-link"

description</a> of the procedure to <i>build</i> a stemcell.

</div>

## 0. Download the Stemcell to Customize

We need to make our changes from a Linux machine (macOS can not mount Linux
filesystems as a loopback device). <sup><a href="#macos_mount" class="alert-link">[macOS mount]</a></sup>

We repurpose our [BOSH Lite](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-lite) Director
as a stemcell-building VM (BOSH Lite is already installed on our macOS
workstation, it has mounted our macOS's filesystem under `/vagrant` (simplifies
stemcell transfer and eliminates running-out-of-space issues), and using it to
build our stemcell in no way impedes its ability to perform as a BOSH Director).

```bash
 # we use the BOSH Lite directory as a staging point
cd ~/workspace/bosh-lite
 # download the stemcell:
curl -L https://bosh.io/d/stemcells/bosh-google-kvm-ubuntu-trusty-go_agent?v=3263.3 -o tmp/custom_stemcell_3263.3.tgz
```

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">

<b>Don't download the "Light" stemcell</b>. Certain IaaSes (e.g. Amazon Web
Services (AWS)) have "Light" stemcells as well as "Regular" stemcells, but
"Light" stemcells aren't true stemcells (i.e. they don't contain a bootable disk
image); instead they are pointers to the actual stemcell (in Amazon's case, a
list of Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) by region). Always be sure to download the
regular stemcell. Light stemcells are small, typically ~20kB; Regular stemcells
are large, typically ~600MB. On <a class="alert-link"
href="http://bosh.io/">bosh.io</a>, a light stemcell will be denoted with the
word "Light" (e.g. "AWS Xen-HVM Light").

</div>

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">

<b>Download the "Raw" stemcell</b>. These instructions assume a "raw" stemcell
and  may not work with non-raw images (e.g. vSphere's .ovf format). OpenStack
for example has two types of stemcells: "Raw" and "Regular". "Raw" stemcell's
disk image can be mounted via a loop device and modified. The regular stemcell's
disk image is QEMU Copy On Write (QCOW) formatted and cannot be mounted (thus
cannot be customized). On <a class="alert-link"
href="http://bosh.io/">bosh.io</a>, a raw stemcell will be denoted with the word
"raw" (e.g. "OpenStack KVM (raw)").

</div>

## 1. Use BOSH Lite to Modify stemcell

```bash
 # bring up BOSH Lite (if it isn't already running):
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
 # we are now in a Linux box; we will customize our stemcell here:
 # create our mountpoint
sudo mkdir /mnt/stemcell
cd /vagrant/tmp
mkdir stemcell image
cd stemcell
 # unpack the stemcell:
tar xvf ../custom_stemcell_3263.3.tgz
cd ../image
 # unpack the bootable Linux disk image
tar xvf ../stemcell/image
 # connect the bootable Linux disk image to a loopback device
 # the extracted file may be `disk.raw` instead of `root.img`
sudo losetup /dev/loop0 root.img
 # probe for the new partitions
sudo partprobe /dev/loop0
 # mount the disk image
sudo mount /dev/loop0p1 /mnt/stemcell
 # we like to use chroot to avoid accidentally polluting the BOSH Lite filesystem
sudo chroot /mnt/stemcell /bin/bash
 # update the stemcell to 3263.3.1
echo -n 3263.3.1 > /var/vcap/bosh/etc/stemcell_version
 # we create user 'cunnie' in the admin, bosh_sudoers, and bosh_sshers groups
 # (sudo & ssh), passwd `c1oudc0w`.
 # CentOS stemcells should use group wheel instead of group admin
useradd -m -G admin,bosh_sudoers,bosh_sshers -p $(openssl passwd -1 -salt xyz c1oudc0w) cunnie
 # change to the new user's homedir
cd ~cunnie
 # we create the directory
mkdir .ssh
 # install the public key
echo 'ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQC9An3FOF/vUnEA2VkaYHoACjbmk3G4yAHE3lXnGpIhz3EV5k4B5RzEFKZnAIFcX18eBjYQIN9xQO0L9xkhlCyrQHrnXBjCDwt/BuQSiRvp3tlx9g0tGyuuJRI5n656Shc7w/g4UbrQWUBdLKjxTT4kTgAdK+1pgDbhAXdPtMwt4D/sz5OEFdf5O5Cp+0spxC+Ctdb94taZhScqB4xt6dRl7bwI28vZdq6Sjg/hbMBbTXzSJ17+ql8LJtXiUHO5W7MwNtKdZmlglOUy3CEIwDz3FdI9zKEfnfpfosp/hu+07/8Y02+U/fsjQyJy8ZCSsGY2e2XpvNNVj/3mnj8fP5cX cunnie@nono.io' > .ssh/authorized_keys
 # set ownerships and permissions
chmod 700 .ssh
chmod 600 .ssh/authorized_keys
chown -R cunnie:cunnie .ssh
 # we're done, hop back to our "normal" BOSH Lite root filesystem
exit
 # unmount our filesystem
sudo umount /mnt/stemcell
 # delete our loop device
sudo losetup -d /dev/loop0
 # tar up our modified Linux bootable disk image
tar czvf ../stemcell/image *
```

<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">

Configure a DNS server if the customization requires connecting to the internet
(e.g. `apt install telnetd`): `echo 'nameserver 8.8.8.8' > /etc/resolv.conf`.

</div>

<p />

We find it good practice to modify the stemcell number when customizing a
stemcell — it prevents many kinds of errors, and well worth the additional time
spent  re-compiling BOSH releases. In this example, we bump the stemcell number
to `3263.3.1`:

```bash
 # change back to our stemcell directory
cd ../stemcell
 # update the manifest to use a new stemcell number
vi stemcell.MF
```

```diff
-version: '3263.3'
+version: '3263.3.1'
bosh_protocol: 1
sha1: 6dec63560e5ee516e8495eeb39553e81049e19b8
operating_system: ubuntu-trusty
cloud_properties:
  name: bosh-google-kvm-ubuntu-trusty-go_agent
-  version: '3263.3'
+  version: '3263.3.1'
```

We create our new, custom stemcell; we put the new version number in the name:

```bash
 # create the stemcell
tar czvf ../custom_stemcell_3263.3.1.tgz *
 # exit the Vagrant ssh session
exit
```

## 2. Upload the New Stemcell

We upload our new stemcell to our director, which takes ~6 minutes with our
internet connection.

```bash
 # we upload the stemcell to our BOSH Director
bosh upload-stemcell ~/workspace/bosh-lite/tmp/custom_stemcell_3263.3.1.tgz
```

## 3. Deploy

We use the new BOSH Golang CLI to deploy: <sup>[[Golang CLI](#golangcli)]</sup>

```bash
bosh deploy -d concourse concourse-ntp-pdns-gce.yml \
  -l <(lpass show --note deployments) \
  -l <(curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cunnie/sslip.io/master/conf/sslip.io%2Bnono.io.yml) \
  --no-redact
```

## 4. Test

We test our custom stemcell by ssh'ing into our newly-deployed VM
(ns-gce.nono.io) using the special user account we created, "cunnie", with our
private key:

```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/google cunnie@ns-gce.nono.io
```

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">

<b>Don't assume too much when customizing</b>. Stemcells are different beasts
than most UNIX distributions: for example, `/tmp/` is not world-writeable,
d&aelig;mons such as `rsyslog` and `sshd` are restarted several times by several
different mechanisms (e.g. upstart, `kill`), directories are obscured by
subsequent bind-mounts (don't add any files to `/var/log` and expect to find
them). Tread carefully, the ice is thin.

</div>

## 5. Alternate Stemcell Formats: `.vmdk`

[Virtual Machine Disk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VMDK) (VMDK) is a
format frequently used by VMware and VirtualBox virtualization.

The above instructions do _not_ work for `.vmdk`-format disks; however,
such disks _can_ be customized with additional steps. The steps require
the executable `qemu-img`, a utility which converts different
disk formats.

We need to convert the `.vmdk` to a raw disk image (`root.img`);
Run the following command _after_ running `tar xvf ../stemcell/image`
in the instructions above:

```bash
if [ -f image-disk1.vmdk ]; then
  qemu-img convert image-disk1.vmdk -O raw root.img
fi
```

Similarly, when we tar up the new stemcell, we need to convert
the raw disk image (`root.img`) back to a `.vmdk`. Run the
following command _after_ running `sudo losetup -d /dev/loop0`
in the instructions above:

```bash
if [ -f image-disk1.vmdk ]; then
  rm image-disk1.vmdk
  qemu-img convert root.img -O vmdk image-disk1.vmdk
  # For Vmware Vsphere
  # qemu-img convert -o subformat=streamOptimized,compat6 root.img -O vmdk image-disk1.vmdk
  rm root.img
  SHASUM=($(shasum image-disk1.vmdk))
  perl -pi -e "s/vmdk\)=\s\S+\$/vmdk\)= $SHASUM/" image.mf
fi
```

Note that we have taken the opportunity to update the
Secure Hash Algorithms
([SHA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Hash_AlgorithmsSHA))
inside the image's manifest (`image.mf`).
If we didn't update the SHA, the stemcell would fail to upload to
the director.

## Footnotes

<a name="macos_mount"><sup>[macOS mount]</sup></a> We would be interested if
someone has mounted a Linux filesystem to a macOS machine using a loopback
device. If the procedure is not too burdensome, we may include it in our blog
post.

<a name="golangcli"><sup>[Golang CLI]</sup></a> We are using an experimental
Golang-based BOSH command line interface
([CLI](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-cli)), and the arguments are
slightly different than those of canonical Ruby-based [BOSH
CLI](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh/tree/master/bosh_cli); however, the
arguments are similar enough to be readily adapted to the Ruby CLI (e.g. the
Golang CLI's `bosh upload-stemcell` equivalent to the Ruby CLI's `bosh upload
stemcell` (no dash)).

The new CLI also allows variable interpolation, with the value of the variables
to interpolate passed in via YAML file on the command line. This feature allows
the redaction of sensitive values (e.g. SSL keys) from the manifest. The format
is similar to Concourse's interpolation, except that interpolated values are
bracketed by double parentheses "((key))", whereas Concourse uses double curly
braces "{{key}}".

Similar to Concourse, the experimental BOSH CLI allows the YAML file containing
the secrets to be passed via the command line, e.g. `-l ~/secrets.yml` or
`-l <(lpass show --note secrets)`

The Golang CLI is in alpha and should not be used on production systems.

## Corrections & Updates

*2017-07-04*

Added instructions for customizing `.vmdk` stemcells.

*2017-04-12*

Userid created is a member of the `bosh_sshers` and `bosh_sudoers` groups.
Newer stemcells have been hardened to only allow ssh access to users who
are a member of the `bosh_sshers` group.
